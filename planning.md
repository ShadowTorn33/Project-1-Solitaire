                            Solitaire
- Create a deck to be used which contains 52 cards in total.

- In the deck, we have 4 suits.
    * Spades (Black)
    * Hearts (Red)
    * Diamonds (Red)
    * Clubs (Black)

- Each suit goes up to the number 13.
    * Ace = 1
    * Two = 2
    * Three = 3
    * Four = 4
    * Five = 5
    * Six = 6
    * Seven = 7
    * Eight = 8
    * Nine = 9
    * Ten = 10
    * Jack = 11
    * Queen = 12
    * King = 13

- Create an object that holds multiple arrays.

- Create arrays for inside your object that holds each suit.

- Create a nested loop to push in each suit to the array.

- Create a function for shuffling the deck

- Create an inline row that holds 7 columns.


- The next 7 columns are where your playable piles are.
    * The top card is faced up while the rest are faced down.

- There are collection piles that store each suit (4 in total) in chronological order.

- Create event listeners if/when needed.

- Create a discard pile that stores the cards not used from the draw pile.
    * We then need to add those cards back into the draw pile in the same order.
